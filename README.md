# Industry-Project-Node.js

This Node.js application serves as a comparative study to an ASP.NET app, exploring and contrasting their development approaches. Through this project, I aim to showcase the capabilities and features of Node.js while highlighting its differences from other technologies. Feel free to explore the functionalities and contribute to the ongoing comparison.
